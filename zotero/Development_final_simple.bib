	abstract = {The authors propose a new climatic drought index: the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index ({SPEI}). The {SPEI} is based on precipitation and temperature data, and it has the advantage of combining multiscalar character with the capacity to include the effects of temperature variability on drought assessment. The procedure to calculate the index is detailed and involves a climatic water balance, the accumulation of deficit/surplus at different time scales, and adjustment to a log-logistic probability distribution. Mathematically, the {SPEI} is similar to the standardized precipitation index ({SPI}), but it includes the role of temperature. Because the {SPEI} is based on a water balance, it can be compared to the self-calibrated Palmer drought severity index (sc-{PDSI}). Time series of the three indices were compared for a set of observatories with different climate characteristics, located in different parts of the world. Under global warming conditions, only the sc-{PDSI} and {SPEI} identified an increase in drought severity associated with higher water demand as a result of evapotranspiration. Relative to the sc-{PDSI}, the {SPEI} has the advantage of being multiscalar, which is crucial for drought analysis and monitoring.},

	abstract = {This paper reveals a stark inequality in the effect of ambient temperatures on death in human populations. Using district-level daily weather and annual mortality data from 1957 to 2000, we find that hot days lead to substantial increases in mortality in rural but not urban India. Despite being far poorer, the mortality response in urban India is not dissimilar to that in the {US} over the same period. Looking into potential mechanisms we find that the rural death effects are driven by hot days in the growing season which reduce productivity and wages in agriculture. Consistent with a model of endogenous survival in the face of credit constraints, we also find that the expansion of bank branches into rural India helped to mitigate these effects. When coupled with a climatological model that predicts many more hot days in a typical year by the end of this century, these estimates imply considerable reductions in rural Indian, but not urban Indian or {US}, life expectancy ceteris paribus.},

Productivity shocks cause larger changes in the wage when workers are poorer, less able to migrate, and more credit‐constrained because of such workers’ inelastic labor supply. This equilibrium wage effect hurts workers. In contrast, it acts as insurance for landowners. Agricultural wage data for 257 districts in India for 1956–87 are used to test the predictions, with rainfall as an instrument for agricultural productivity. In districts with fewer banks or higher migration costs, the wage is much more responsive to fluctuations in productivity.},

	abstract = {Climate scientists have spent billions of dollars and eons of supercomputer time studying how increased concentrations of greenhouse gases and changes in the reflectivity of the earth’s surface affect dimensions of the climate system relevant to human society: surface temperature, precipitation, humidity, and sea levels. Recent incarnations of physical climate models have become sophisticated enough to be able to simulate intensities and frequencies of some extreme events, like tropical storms, under different warming scenarios. In a stark juxtaposition, the efforts involved in and the public resources targeted at understanding how these physical changes translate into economic impacts are disproportionately smaller, with most of the major models being developed and maintained with little to no public funding support. The goal of this paper is first to shed light on how (mostly) economists have gone about calculating the “social cost of carbon” for regulatory purposes and to provide an overview of the past and currently used estimates. In the second part, I will focus on where empirical economists may have the highest value added in this enterprise: specifically, the calibration and estimation of economic damage functions, which map weather patterns transformed by climate change into economic benefits and damages. A broad variety of econometric methods have recently been used to parameterize the dose (climate) response (economic outcome) functions. The paper seeks to provide an accessible and comprehensive overview of how economists think about parameterizing damage functions and quantifying the economic damages of climate change.},

	url = {https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC144234},
	abstract = {Drought conditions have affected large parts of south-eastern Europe, the eastern Mediterranean, and the Black Sea since early 2025, with a partial and temporary recovery in late spring and another worsening in early summer, with concern for the coming months. Above-average temperatures in January 2025, coinciding with the beginning of rainfall deficits, sped up the onset of the drought, leading to dry soil moisture anomaly in the region. The Low-Flow Index ({LFI}) increased progressively from December 2024 to August 2025, affecting central and eastern Europe, Türkiye, and the Middle East. Impacts on vegetation were limited in spring when the warmer temperatures accelerated and anticipated vegetation grow, while in early summer adverse vegetation conditions emerged, peaking in July 2025, and continued into the autumn. The statistics on wildfires mirror the impacts of the aforementioned conditions on vegetation. Most of the countries in the area of interest recorded values of burnt area above the previous 18-year average. Seasonal forecasts point to a warmer-than-usual and severely dryer-than-usual 2025 autumn. The drought affected water resources and already caused significant yield losses of summer crops in Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Greece, Ukraine, and Türkiye, particularly for grain maize and sunflower.},

	abstract = {With 21 \% of gross domestic product ({GDP}) in agricultural sector and having consistently experienced natural disasters (e.g., drought, ﬂood), Armenia is very vulnerable to climate and its change. Given the fact that 63 \% of the entire land is planted with grains, this study primarily focuses on the market for wheat ﬂour and bread. Economic welfare loss due to drought episodes is calculated using the economic data integrated with climate measures. Economic data are utilized for the period 1995–2011 (obtained from Statistical Ofﬁce of Armenia) and speciﬁcally include the quantity produced and consumed of wheat ﬂour and bread combined with mean prices, population income, {GDP} in the agricultural sector, {GDP} in the planting sector, and governmental expenditure on subsidies. Climate data include temperature and precipitation during the period 1966–2011 (obtained from National Hydrometeorological Service of Armenia). The analysis includes three main components. The ﬁrst utilizes a market framework that analyzes the impact of climate on equilibrium prices and quantities as well as trade and tax effects. The second employs a logarithmic utility function to estimate the effective insurance policy for the agricultural sector using risk management strategies. Lastly, a macroeconomic model has been developed to assess the efﬁcient sum of governmental expenditure on subsidies and irrigation during the drought episodes and during the mean climatic conditions. All three parts of the study are developed for the ﬁrst time.},
